# ideatecomm25-iot Workshop Template

This repository is a template for participants in the IdeateComm25 workshop to quickly get started building an Internet of Things (IoT) system using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk platform.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Click the green "Use this template" button on GitHub, or clone it directly:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/soeeig/ideatecomm25-iot.git
     ```
2. **Install Prerequisites**
   - Ensure you have the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed.
   - Install the ESP32 board support via the Boards Manager.
   - In the Arduino IDE, install the [Blynk library](https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/installation) using the Library Manager.

3. **Configure Your ESP32**
   - Open `main.ino` or the main source file.
   - Enter your WiFi credentials (SSID and password).
   - Create a [Blynk](https://blynk.io/) account and set up your project.
   - Copy your Blynk authentication token into the code.

4. **Flash the ESP32**
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB.
   - Select the correct port and board in your IDE.
   - Upload the code to your ESP32.

5. **Test and Extend**
   - Open the Blynk app and control your ESP32.
   - Try connecting sensors or actuators and expand your IoT system!

## Workshop Goals

- Learn how to set up and program an ESP32 for IoT applications.
- Use Blynk to build mobile interfaces and interact with your device over the internet.
- Experiment, customize, and create your own connected solutions.
