# Code Template for IoT Implementation

This repository is a template for participants in the Internet of Thinigs workshop (Part of IdeateCOMM Challenge 2025) to quickly get started building an Internet of Things (IoT) system using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk platform.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Option 1: Click the green "Code" button on GitHub, and download the ZIP file. Open the file `iot_blynk.ino`
   - Option 2: Create a new sketch in Arduino IDE. Copy the code from `iot_blynk.ino` and paste it there.
    
2. **Install Prerequisites**
   - Ensure you have the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and PubSubClient library installed.
   - Install the ESP32 board support via the Boards Manager.
   - In the Arduino IDE, install the PubSubClient library using the Library Manager
