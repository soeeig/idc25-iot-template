# Code Template for IoT Implementation

This repository is a template for participants in the Internet of Thinigs workshop (Part of IdeateCOMM Challenge 2025) to quickly get started building an Internet of Things (IoT) system using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk platform.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Option 1: Click the green "Code" button on GitHub, and download the ZIP file. Open the file `iot_blynk.ino`
   - Option 2: Create a new sketch in Arduino IDE. Copy the code from `iot_blynk.ino` and paste it there.
    
2. **Install Prerequisites**
   - Ensure you have the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed.
   - Install the ESP32 board support via the Boards Manager.
   - In the Arduino IDE, install the [Blynk library](https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/installation) using the Library Manager.

3. **Configure Your ESP32**
   - Open `main.ino` or the main source file.
   - Enter your WiFi credentials (SSID and password).
   - Create a [Blynk](https://blynk.io/) account and set up your project.
   - Copy your Blynk authentication token into the code.

4. **Flash the ESP32**
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB.
   - Select the correct port and board in your IDE.
   - Upload the code to your ESP32.

5. **Test and Extend**
   - Open the Blynk app and control your ESP32.
   - Try connecting sensors or actuators and expand your IoT system!

## Workshop Goals

- Learn how to set up and program an ESP32 for IoT applications.
- Use Blynk to build mobile interfaces and interact with your device over the internet.
- Experiment, customize, and create your own connected solutions.
